>>> *****LOST*****

LOST is a turn-based combat RPG game where we play as a boy who 
seeks to avenge his family’s death, caused by their enemies in a 
housefire.  The boy has no clue of as to who these people are and 
why they did it, and so, the story will unfold with the boy 
investigating around the world map to find out more. 
As he pieces things together by gathering clues, he will be able
to exactly pinpoint where his family’s enemies are located and 
finally be able to return the favour.

The world map will be based on a fictional location called 
“Kingsland” with many smaller sectors inside of it, rich for 
the players of the game to explore.

People in Kingsland are born with special talents for combat: 

> Physical, Telekinetic, and Elemental. 

Each of those special talents consists of long-range and short-range attack types.
The list below shows the strengths and weaknesses of the attributes against each other.

If the player chooses an attack that is weak against the enemies’ 
attack during the selection process, the attack will be cancelled 
by the enemies’.
No damage will be dealt to them and you will receive damage instead.
Vice versa.


`` Strong against >> ``
`` Weak against << ``

- Physical (Long-range) >> Elemental (Long-range)
- Physical (Long-range) << Telekinetic (Long-range)
- Physical (Short-range) >> Telekinetic (Short-range)
- Physical (Short-range) << Elemental (Short-range)


- Telekinetic (Long-range) >> Physical (Long-range)
- Telekinetic (Long-range) << Elemental (Long-range)
- Telekinetic (Short-range) >> Elemental (Short-range)
- Telekinetic (Short-range) << Physical (Short-range)


- Elemental (Long-range) >> Telekinetic (Long-range)
- Elemental (Long-range) << Physical (Long-range)
- Elemental (Short-range) >> Physical (Short-range)
- Elemental (Short-range) << Telekinetic (Short-range)

Same talents will go through normal combat with no cancellations.

Players will be able to interact with objects scattered throughout the world map by executing an action on them or by simply picking them up. Items picked up will be stored in the player’s inventory; there is also an inventory management system (limited allowance on what they can carry at a time).
